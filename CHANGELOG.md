# CHANGELOG for 2.2

This changelog consists of the bug & security fixes and new features being included in the releases listed below.

## **v2.2.5 (Upcoming)**

* [feature] Added Chinese (Simplified) `zh_CN` translation for the Admin, Installer, DataTransfer, WebForm and Core packages.

* [feature] Added a configurable default dashboard date range — 1 month, 3 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years or a custom number of days — under Configuration > General > Settings > Dashboard Configurations.

* [fixed] Fixed menu item names set in Configuration not applying to section pages, breadcrumbs and the mobile sidebar. Previously only the desktop sidebar reflected a rename.

* [fixed] Fixed renaming the "Mail" and "Contacts" menu items having no effect anywhere, as their configuration fields did not match the actual menu keys.

* [fixed] Fixed the dashboard date range label omitting the year on ranges spanning more than one calendar year, which rendered as "30 Jul - 30 Jul".

* [fixed] Fixed Arabic DataTransfer translations never loading, as the file was named `ar/ar.php` instead of `ar/app.php`.

* [fixed] Fixed the missing Korean translation for the "None" input validation option on the create and edit attribute forms.

* [enhancement] Moved the Core and DataTransfer package translations into the Admin package. Only packages that ship their own Blade views now carry a `Resources/lang` directory.

* [enhancement] Reduced database queries on every admin page by loading the configured menu names in a single query instead of one per menu item.

* [enhancement] Documented the localization convention in the `crm-package-development` agent skill and in AGENTS.md.
* [feature] Added a collapse/expand toggle to the admin sidebar, matching the Bagisto admin. The choice is remembered across page loads, and page content now reflows to the sidebar width instead of being overlaid by it. The sidebar no longer expands on hover; it is controlled by the toggle only.

* [feature] Added an option to show or hide the "Powered by" bar under Configuration > General > Settings > Powered by Section Configurations.
